# Landing Page - Immediate Edge #

The page is fully responsive for screens with a width of 350px and more.

The landing page was made according to the BEM methodology. Any blocks can be reused.

Responsive-adaptive layout was created by using "rubber blocks", flexboxes and media queries.

Media-breakpoints: 350px, 576px, 768px, 992px, 1410px and more.

Modal window and accordion are written in pure Javascript.

All transitions and hover-effects are performed with a 600ms delay.

The SASS preprocessor with SCSS syntax was used.

Fonts are placed in a separate file "_fonts".

The "year" in footer updates automatically from js-file.

The JavaScript code is placed in separate modules: accordion.js, footer.js, modal.js.

For implementation of the project, was used Parcel-Bundler. It's easy to set up and very fast.
